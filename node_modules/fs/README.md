# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual online event where a new coding puzzle is released each day from December 1st to December 25th. The puzzles are designed to be solved with code and range in difficulty from beginner to advanced. Each puzzle has two parts and you earn a star for each part you solve. The goal is to collect all 50 stars by Christmas.

## Structure of this Repository

The solutions for each year are in separate directories named after the year (e.g., `2023`). Within each year's directory, there are separate directories for each day's puzzles (e.g., `Day-01`, `Day-02`, etc.). Each day's directory contains a README.md file with the problem description and one or more solution files.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the directory containing the solution file and run the solution file with the appropriate command for your programming language.

## Contributing

While I appreciate the thought, this repository is for my personal solutions and I am not accepting contributions. However, I encourage you to create your own Advent of Code solutions repository!
